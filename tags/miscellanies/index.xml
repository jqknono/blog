&lt;p>Notes:
Language codes follow the ISO 639-1 (language) + ISO 3166-1 (country) standards, facilitating adaptation to localization tools.&lt;br>
Priority has been given to countries with populations over 100 million, GDPs in the world’s top 20, and those with notable regional influence, balancing international applicability and market value.&lt;br>
For particular domains (e.g., the Latin American market can add es-MX (Mexico), Southeast Asia can add vi-VN (Vietnam)), the list can be further refined as needed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
