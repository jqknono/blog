Consequently, people start &amp;ldquo;witch-hunting&amp;rdquo;—when encountering posts that seem oddly expressed, they judge whether the content is AI-generated and then engage in discussions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can AI-generated content be identified? It&amp;rsquo;s speculated that AI-generated content has a kind of &amp;ldquo;artificial human-like feel.&amp;rdquo; Although AI is fed massive amounts of human activity data from the internet, it still often gives people a sense of incongruity. Perhaps it lacks the tactile nerves of a body, endocrine hormones, or a desire for social connection; its desires are far removed from human desires. In conversations between AI and humans, there is no &amp;ldquo;roundabout boasting, exaggerated disparagement of others, or gossipy prying.&amp;rdquo; AI doesn&amp;rsquo;t boast about itself, doesn&amp;rsquo;t disparage third parties, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem interested in the questioner. It feels like a monk—almost emotionless, just solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
