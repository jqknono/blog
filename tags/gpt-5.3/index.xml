From a business perspective, this decision is easy to understand. GPT-5.3-Codex is priced the same as the standard GPT-5.3, but its outputs are more proactive, execution time is shorter, and memory usage is lower, which translates to higher profit margins. For OpenAI, GPT-5.3-Codex is clearly a more cost-effective option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first week after GPT-5.3-Codex was released, the user experience was indeed impressive. The model&amp;rsquo;s response speed was noticeably better than previous versions, and code generation feedback was very prompt. In development scenarios that require rapid iteration and frequent interaction, this efficiency boost brings tangible productivity improvements. When multiple implementation options or quick idea validation are needed in a short time, Codex&amp;rsquo;s proactive output proves especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
