Consequently, people start &amp;ldquo;witch-hunting&amp;rdquo;—when encountering posts that seem oddly expressed, they judge whether the content is AI-generated and then engage in discussions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can AI-generated content be identified? It&amp;rsquo;s speculated that AI-generated content has a kind of &amp;ldquo;artificial human-like feel.&amp;rdquo; Although AI is fed massive amounts of human activity data from the internet, it still often gives people a sense of incongruity. Perhaps it lacks the tactile nerves of a body, endocrine hormones, or a desire for social connection; its desires are far removed from human desires. In conversations between AI and humans, there is no &amp;ldquo;roundabout boasting, exaggerated disparagement of others, or gossipy prying.&amp;rdquo; AI doesn&amp;rsquo;t boast about itself, doesn&amp;rsquo;t disparage third parties, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem interested in the questioner. It feels like a monk—almost emotionless, just solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Useful Mouse Key Mapping Share</title><link>https://blog.jqknono.com/blog/2025/11/07/useful-mouse-key-mapping-share/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:09:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jqknono.com/blog/2025/11/07/useful-mouse-key-mapping-share/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mouse 5&lt;/code&gt; key mapped to &lt;code&gt;F12&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;F12&lt;/code&gt; is the &amp;ldquo;Go to Definition&amp;rdquo; function in Visual Studio and VS Code
&lt;code&gt;Shift + F12&lt;/code&gt; is the &amp;ldquo;Find All References&amp;rdquo; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows for a more comfortable posture when browsing code. Right-handed users can give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
