&lt;p&gt;I have 10 months of experience using the Claude model and have used Gemini/DeepSeek/glm/grok sporadically. I really dislike models that don&amp;rsquo;t think. I have to admit that Claude can work for long periods and is good at using tools, but its error rate is high, leading to low usability of the results, and it often requires adjustments. However, Claude&amp;rsquo;s adjustment ability is very poor; it will repeatedly, extensively, disruptively, and superfluously wander through the codebase, crapping all over the place. After having to hard reset several hours of work multiple times, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a deep aversion to this kind of &amp;ldquo;busy but dumb&amp;rdquo; behavior from Claude. Its working style is suitable for research, producing content that looks plausible but doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny—essentially, fluff pieces. Or for operating browsers, executing tools, writing small scripts, or making minor page edits. That&amp;rsquo;s its ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
