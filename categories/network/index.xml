They themselves are large middlemen. Their primary function is security; there are too many attackers on the internet, and choosing a large middleman has more benefits than drawbacks. Secondary functions include providing DNS, CDN, WAF, and other edge services simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services like Cloudflare can effectively defend against DDoS, trading a slight increase in latency for protection capability, which is very cost-effective. Every site owner should directly use such services; network attacks are everywhere, no need to be optimistic, you&amp;rsquo;ll be attacked sooner or later. Some attacks exploit vulnerabilities, related to the site operator&amp;rsquo;s skill level. Other attacks aim to consume resources, like DDoS, exploiting the cost asymmetry between commercial and home networks—a kind of open conspiracy. Often, you can only fight back with money or shut down the service directly, abandoning all users, also known as black hole defense.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
