&lt;p>At first I thought the IP belonged to an attacker, but inspecting the flows revealed it was simply a certain vendor’s App frantically querying DNS. The backend sets &lt;code>TTL=10&lt;/code>, meaning any client that has just received the DNS response should cache it for ten seconds instead of re-querying the DNS server. Yet the App pounds the server with dozens of identical requests every second, proving it never honors the TTL. In our blocking statistics, more than 90 % of intercepted requests are for this single domain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
